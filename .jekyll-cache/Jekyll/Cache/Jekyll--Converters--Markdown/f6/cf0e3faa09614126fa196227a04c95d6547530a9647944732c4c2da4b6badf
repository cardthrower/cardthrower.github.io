I";<p>I previously wrote a great deal of things for the UTD Mercury, but for easy reading this is a collection of reviews I did for
“The Fix”, a coffee shop review column that I’ll be continuing under the name “Practical Caffeine Spots” because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Mercury owns the rights to “The Fix” and</li>
  <li>Someone else is continuing that particular column there and</li>
  <li>I don’t particularly care about having a catchy title for a personal writing project.</li>
</ol>

<p>I liked writing reviews in that particular style, so I’ll keep doing it for fun.</p>
