title: Previous Coffee Shop Reviews
---
I previously wrote a great deal of things for the UTD Mercury, but for easy reading this is a collection of reviews I did for
"The Fix", a coffee shop review column that I'll be continuing under the name "Practical Caffeine Spots" because:
1. The Mercury owns the rights to "The Fix" and
2. Someone else is continuing that particular column there and
3. I don't particularly care about having a catchy title for a personal writing project.

I liked writing reviews in that particular style, so I'll keep doing it for fun.

If you'd like to keep following Practical Caffeine Spots, I'll keep to a similar criteria, albeit expanded a little from the Richardson area:
  - Is it good? (Generally test with a vanilla latte/espresso and/or tea if available)
  - Is it expensive? (6 dollars for 12 oz better get me something amazing or the shop is a local shop that deserves the support)
  - How's the other stuff? (Wifi, travel time, available seating, etc. etc.)
