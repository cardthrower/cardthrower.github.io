    <h1><h1>Previous Coffee Shop Reviews</h1>

<p>
  07 Mar 2022
</p>

<p>I previously wrote a great deal of things for the UTD Mercury, but for easy reading this is a collection of reviews I did for
“The Fix”, a coffee shop review column that I’ll be continuing under the name “Practical Caffeine Spots” because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Mercury owns the rights to “The Fix” and</li>
  <li>Someone else is continuing that particular column there and</li>
  <li>I don’t particularly care about having a catchy title for a personal writing project.</li>
</ol>

<p>I liked writing reviews in that particular style, so I’ll keep doing it for fun.</p>

<p>If you’d like to keep following Practical Caffeine Spots, I’ll keep to a similar criteria, albeit expanded a little from the Richardson area:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it good? (Generally test with a vanilla latte/espresso and/or tea if available)</li>
  <li>Is it expensive? (6 dollars for 12 oz better get me something amazing or the shop is a local shop that deserves the support)</li>
  <li>How’s the other stuff? (Wifi, travel time, available seating, etc. etc.)</li>
</ul>
